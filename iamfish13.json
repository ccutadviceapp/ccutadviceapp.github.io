Here's what beginners need to know about gameplay before diving in.<\/p><img alt=\"I Am Fish Official Screenshot\" src=\"https:\/\/static0.gamerantimages.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/I-Am-Fish-Official-Screenshot.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"auto\"> <!-- No winning ad found for zone: below main pic! --><section id=\"article-body\" class=\"article-body\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\r\n \r\n<p><strong><em>I Am Fish<\/em> <\/strong>is a fun adventure in which players take control of four different fish friends who are separated by circumstances out of their control and have to overcome various challenges in order to be reunited. Most of the focus is on physics-based puzzles that offer a variety of interesting gameplay options.<\/p>\r\n<!-- No winning ad found for zone: below first paragraph! -->\r\n<!-- No winning ad found for zone: mid intro! -->\r\n\r\n<p>The full story includes four different sections-one for each of the fish, that are each made up of three levels. Each section of the game offers gameplay variations that introduce different types of obstacles for the player to overcome. For its simplistic mechanics, some of the puzzles can be surprisingly challenging. But there are a few useful things to know when playing this difficult game that will help with getting through it. For those looking to try out this game, <em>I Am Fish <\/em>is available on Xbox Game Pass.<\/p><\/section><\/div>",
    "slide_title_1" : "1: Keep an Eye on Your Container's Condition!",
    "slide_content_1" : "<div style=\"-moz-user-select: none;-webkit-user-select: none;-ms-user-select: none;-o-user-select: none;user-select: none;\"><div class=\"body-img landscape\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" alt=\"I Am Fish Goldfish Bowl\" src=\"https:\/\/static0.gamerantimages.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/I-Am-Fish-Goldfish-Bowl.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"auto\">\r\n <\/div>\r\n \r\n<p>Because the main characters are fish, and none of them are mudskippers, it is imperative that they minimize any time spent outside of water. This means that when a large body of water is not available, a container of water will have to suffice. Usually, this function is served either by a fishbowl or a glass jar, though some levels opt for more creative choices such as a janitor's cleaning bucket or drinking glasses.<\/p>\r\n<p>Containers can be moved by swimming against the edge, and players can take advantage of the physical environment to build up momentum. This can come with its own challenges, such as having to avoid falling off of high ledges while rolling along narrow paths.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But one detail that might not be obvious is bowls and jars can take damage. Too much damage will cause them to shatter, leaving the fish stranded. It is easy to monitor the condition of the bowl or jar- every time it takes damage, cracks will appear in the glass. The more cracks are visible, the worse its condition and the more likely it is to be broken.<\/p><\/div>",
    "slide_title_2" : "2: The Game Has Stealth Mechanics!",
    "slide_content_2" : "<div style=\"-moz-user-select: none;-webkit-user-select: none;-ms-user-select: none;-o-user-select: none;user-select: none;\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" alt=\"I Am Fish Pufferfish Seagul\" src=\"https:\/\/static0.gamerantimages.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/I-Am-Fish-Pufferfish-Seagul.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"auto\">\r\n \r\n<p> Some sections of <em>I Am Fish <\/em>actually require the player to evade specific enemies, usually seagulls. Such enemies act as obstacles that can't be directly fought but can be avoided once the player knows the right tricks. Seagulls will frequently try to strike at the fish if they are spotted. The best way to evade them is to avoid moving whenever their attention is drawn. If the fish keeps moving, they will draw more attention until the gulls start diving at them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Holding still will cause the gulls to lose interest and direct their attention elsewhere. Of course, this is often easier said than done. Gulls tend to attack when the fish is in a jar or bowl, and sometimes they need to move in order to steady their container so it does not fall off a high platform and shatter. When this happens, the fish will want to minimize movement that is nonessential.<\/p><\/div>",
    "slide_title_3" : "3: Bowls and Jars Can be Unreliable Vehicles",
    "slide_content_3" : "<div style=\"-moz-user-select: none;-webkit-user-select: none;-ms-user-select: none;-o-user-select: none;user-select: none;\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" alt=\"I am Fish Pirhanna\" src=\"https:\/\/static0.gamerantimages.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/I-am-Fish-Pirhanna.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"auto\">\r\n \r\n<p> The fish regularly have to navigate difficult terrain by moving in bowls and jars full of water. These can be moved simply by swimming against the edge causing them to roll forward. But both can be difficult to move with precision, especially the jars. It is very difficult to keep a jar moving in a straight line. While pushing a jar, it is likely to veer off to the left or right, potentially making it hard to stay on the right path. The best way to move jars with some reliability is to <strong>swim back and forth between both ends <\/strong>while pushing. This way, the fish can correct any unwanted veering and keep it moving somewhat straight.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bowls are slightly easier to maneuver, but they can have their own challenges as well. While it is easier to keep a bowl moving straight, it can easily build up momentum. Once a bowl starts moving, especially down a slope, it can be hard to make it stop. In some cases, this can work to the fish's advantage, but it can also create problems.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some sections require the fishbowl to be rolled along elevated paths without falling, or rolling into a very precise spot- at full speed, it can be very hard to stop the bowl from rolling off a cliff or into an obstacle. It is possible to slow down and stop the bowl's rolling by swimming in the opposite direction, but players should keep an eye on its momentum to know when to do this.<\/p><\/div>",
    "slide_title_4" : "4. Each Fish Has Different Skills",
    "slide_content_4" : "<div style=\"-moz-user-select: none;-webkit-user-select: none;-ms-user-select: none;-o-user-select: none;user-select: none;\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" alt=\"I am Fish Pufferfish Rolling\" src=\"https:\/\/static0.gamerantimages.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/I-am-Fish-Pufferfish-Rolling.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"auro\">\r\n \r\n<p>There are four playable characters in the game, each a different type of fish that comes with its own strengths and weaknesses. This also means that each of them has a unique playstyle. Three of them also have a special ability - pufferfish can inflate, piranha can bite, and flying fish can glide.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first playable character, goldfish, is focused on movement and being able to swim effectively. It also means that some levels will have some unique ways of solving problems. Pufferfish often have to roll between bodies of water or inflate to quickly jump to a higher point. Piranha gets to do lots of property damage by destroying plumbing and flooding houses. This means players will have to adapt to the different playstyles of each fish.<\/p><\/div>",
    "slide_title_5" : "5. Cleaning Buckets and Stairs",
    "slide_content_5" : "<div style=\"-moz-user-select: none;-webkit-user-select: none;-ms-user-select: none;-o-user-select: none;user-select: none;\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" alt=\"I Am Fish Flying Fish Cleaning Bucket\" src=\"https:\/\/static0.gamerantimages.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/I-Am-Fish-Flying-Fish-Cleaning-Bucket.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"auto\">\r\n \r\n<p>In addition to jars and bowls, <em>I Am Fish <\/em>loves to create situations where a janitor's cleaning bucket is needed as a vehicle for one of the fish. Similar to other containers, the bucket can be moved by swimming against the edge, but can be tricky to maneuver with any precision. There is also an additional level of difficulty because cleaning buckets have an open-top, meaning water can be lost. This is especially bad if the bucket gets knocked over, which can happen if it runs into people.<\/p>\r\n<p>As if THAT was not enough, sometimes a bucket has to be driven downstairs - an easy recipe for disaster that can result in the fish getting spilled out. Fortunately, there is a trick to getting the bucket downstairs without getting killed in the process. The best way to accomplish this is to make sure the bucket is oriented <strong>vertically relative to the stairs<\/strong>. It is also important to keep the bucket from falling too quickly, so it is also a good idea to <strong>push at the back end<\/strong>. While not a perfect solution, it can help slow down the bucket and make each step a little easier.<\/p><\/div>",
    "slide_title_6" : "6. Landing On Hard Surfaces",

While in a glass bowl or jar, players need to pay attention to how much damage these containers take. If they take a hard enough fall, these containers can completely shatter and force the player to start over.<\/p>\r\n<p>In order to avoid doing this, players need to keep an eye out for anything that looks like a mat. These are meant to be soft surfaces for the bowl or jar to land on so that way the fish can get down safely.<\/p><\/div>",
    "slide_title_7" : "7. I Not Using The Abilities",
    "slide_content_7" : "<div style=\"-moz-user-select: none;-webkit-user-select: none;-ms-user-select: none;-o-user-select: none;user-select: none;\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" alt=\"Flying as the flying fish in I Am Fish\" src=\"https:\/\/static0.gamerantimages.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/IAmFish_Flying.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"auto\">\r\n \r\n<p>The game has a unique way of changing things up as players switch between the different fish. There are four types of fish in the game: a goldfish, a pufferfish, a piranha, and a flying fish. While the goldfish doesn't do anything special, the other three have unique abilities that are meant to add another layer to either the platforming or puzzle solving.<\/p>\r\n<p>This includes the pufferfish's roll, the piranha's bite, and the flying fish's flight. There may be times where players are stuck and don't know how to advance, but remembering the fish's specific ability may help get them out of a jam.<\/p><\/div>",
    "slide_title_8" : "8. Staying Out Of Water",

After a while, the screen will slowly fade to black and the game over screen will appear.<\/p>\r\n<p>However, it is important to keep an eye on the surroundings in case there is a way to keep the fish alive temporarily. This could include a small body of water that, for example, the pufferfish can roll into. There is an entire section dedicated to the flying fish effectively jumping between water checkpoints. If players can get in the water, do so.<\/p><\/div>",
